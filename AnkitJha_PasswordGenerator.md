## Usage Examples

### Password Generation
```
Enter password length (minimum 8, recommended 12+): 16
Include lowercase letters (a-z)? (y/n): y
Include uppercase letters (A-Z)? (y/n): y
Include digits (0-9)? (y/n): y
Include special characters (!@#$%^&*)? (y/n): y

üéâ Generated Password: K8#mX2@pQ4$nR9*w
```

### Password Validation
```
Enter password to validate: mypassword123

=== Password Analysis ===
Password: my********123
Length: 13 characters
Strength Score: 45/100 (Moderate)
Strength: [‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí     ]

‚úÖ Criteria Met:
